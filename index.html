	Hello World - 

Today we're going to dive into the Occult - which is knowledge held by few - hidden from sight of the masses 

Most humans will go through their entire lifes completely oblivous that such knowledge even exists -

Thus never lifting the veil thats been placed over their eyes to blind them from the truth - that they're slaves Neo - Wake up -

The matrix is everywhere - You were born into a pre fabricated reality - As soon as you're born you are given a name, a religion, a nationality, a race

a social security number to identify you - just another number in the matrix - As a baby you have a built in natural instinct to trust your parents for 

survival - we label them as authority figures - and by the age of 4 you're placed in a government indoctrination camp where you're presented with a new authority 

figure - Teacher - A Puppet whose strings are pulled by the government to tell you what to think, what exists, what doesn't, whats real

what isn't, deliberately sculpting your perception of reality - 


We should be teaching children how to think - not what to think.  Schools serve to condition people to become safe law abiding - government trusting citizens. They 

extrude creativity and critical thinking - discourage uniqueness and out of the box thinking - they don't want you to think for yourself

During World War 2 Nazi Germany was interested in preparing young children for war so Hitler created The Hitler Youth Group to teach young children to 

become obedient soilders - similarly our education system pumps out obedient workers afraid of taking risk programmed to Go to school - Get a job - Pay taxes - 

Save Money - Buy a house because its an asset - Get out of debt - and invest in the stock market - its hipnosis going through your brain - 

The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all, it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level,

to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.  John D Rockefeller - who created our modern education system

literally said - "I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers."  When the entirety of your earnings are exhausted on 

food and shelter, your labors are no longer viewed as an opportunity for economic advancement, but rather as an act of self-preservation.  

In the real world that's called ... Slavery - this is going to sound a bit deranged - but one day while this lovely man was imagining what the perfect prison

would be like - you know - casually / typical - he reached the conclussion that not only would you need consistent surveillance of your prisoners - 

a Panopticon - you'd also need to implement a rigid routine in which every second of the day is full of activities - one hour to eat one hour to

excercise one hour to go to sleep - you'd need to keep prisoners busy - don't spare them a second free to think - because the time they spend eating, working out,

and sleeping is time they aren't commiting crimes or planning an escape - look at it this way  - you can only have one thought at a time - and if the mind is 

always occupied - then you'll never plan an escape - this is why the Roman Poet Juvinal wrote "Give them bread and circuses - and they will never revolt"

Look the evil isn't in the bread and circuses per se, but in the willingness of the people to sell their rights as free men for full bellies and the excitement

of the games which serves to distract them from the other human hungers which bread and circuses can never appease - These principles of vigilence and control 

can be applied at larger scales - why stop at a jail when you can apply them to schools, hospitals, businesses, society - as a matter of fact you can have

a whole Panopticon country. Wouldn't that be terrible ? Look i'm not a criminal, I don't need anyone to control my time to stop me from commiting crimes -

but I do commit other activities of which I don't feel very proud of which I would like to change for more significant ones 

you might not be a criminal - but you do have a routine thats determined by your relationship and obligations to other people 

you wake up early so you don't have to deal with a congested highway or a packed metro - and go to work where they give you an hour to feed your self and continue 

working - and then you get home and make the most out of every second of freedom life allows you  - and the following day you do everything all over again 

You didn't determine this routine - but the circumstances under which you exist 

In society its very easy to chose the personality that the culture you habit offers you - to become what is expected of you - and your discrepancy between

you and the world disappears - and with it the fear of solitude and importance - you can become an automaton - or an NPC - a None Playable Character

- like the background characters in movies or video games whose only purpose is to exist - identical to millions of

NPCs at your surrounding  - free of all anxiety and uncertainty - but the price to pay is higly expensive - you must quit being your self 

The slaves of the new age are not in chains, but in debt - slaves to their impulses - mindless consumers - True freedom is DISCIPLINE - the matrix is a system neo - 

that system is our enemy - guarded by the unenlightened fools around you.  It is in the interest of tyrants to reduce the people to ignorance and vice.  

For they cannot live in any country where virtue and knowledge prevail - when you look around what do you see?  business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, 

all thinking that they earn for themselves - believing the money they use is a tool of trade not of control - you have to understand that most of these people 

are not ready to see it - many of them are so invested - so hopelessly dependent on the system that they would fight to protect it -

Ignorance has always been the weapon of tyrants - Enlightenment the salvation of the free. The brain is mother natures super computer 

and your conscious is the software its running - Your thoughts are mere programs - So you must be wary with what you consume - 

if you're not careful - you could end up with malicious software running in your head - which will affect your life - As former 

Emperor of Rhome Marcus Aurelious once said "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: 

therefore, guard accordingly... the things you think about determine the quality of your mind - your soul takes on the color of your thoughts" 

So make sure you're the only one doing the programming and repel viruses - You achieve this through critical thinking - Question EVERYTHING - 

and explore EVERY possible avenue you can imagine in your mind - like a game of chess - Because eventhough we're no longer sleeping in the wild 

among the trees - We're still subject to predators - Guised as Governments, Businesses, Corporations, Institutions, The Mainstream Media, 

Influencers - not everyone doing the programming has your best intentions in mind - you don't want to be a pawn used to manifest the dreams of others - 

Critical Thinking is your antivirus - filter everything through your own best judgement - don't immediately accept any information as truth, just entertain it in 

your mind - as you collect more knowledge the truth will unveil itself - but don't cling to truth or knowledge - For Socrates, the wisest man to have ever 

live said "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing" - be open to the possibility that everything you know is wrong - 

because the more you know, the more you know you don't know - Only fools know everything -  As Bruce Lee said - "be water my friend" - don't turn your brain hard as 

concrete to the point you can't absorb any new ideas - listen more than you speak - According to plato - “Wise men speak because they have something to say; 

Fools speak because they have to say something” - So when someone is speaking to you - learn to be in the present - shut the mind off and focus -

tune into the conversation - you might learn something from the speaker - because every action and every word that comes out of the speakers mouth originates as

a thought in the brain - so it gives you a glimpse into the workings of their minds and the data they hodl - if you're just eagerly waiting for the speaker to 

shut up so you can say something you already know - you're not listening, therefore you will miss an opportunity to learn something from the speaker -

remember you can only truly focus on one thing at a time efficiently - So be humble - you can learn something from everyone - humans are gods robots and 

everything we know exists as data mind in our minds - When we go to sleep the brain stores new information and gets rid of toxic waste. Nerve cells communicate and 

reorganize, which supports healthy brain function. Neurons in the brain form connections that store all the knowledge and memories that create the illusion of you - 

So everything you learn literally becomes a part of you as neuro connections your brain - This is why people get upset when their beliefs are challenged with new 

information that contradicts what they believe - A mental conflict occurs that activates areas of the brain involved in personal identity and emotional response to 

threats.  The brain's alarms go off when a person feels threatened on a deeply personal and emotional level causing them to shut down and disregard any rational 

evidence that contradicts what they previously regarded as 'truth'.  However truth is not what you want it to be; it is what it is; you must bend to its power or live

a lie.  Therefore you must learn to let go of mindsets that no longer suit you - and adopt new ideologys that help you grow - 

learn to unlearn and relearn - The matrix will program you to think its ok getting $100k into debt for a degree that won't pay itself back - 

and you believe it because its encouraged by your parents and teachers - figures of authority who should know what they're talking about right?  

Look if you can't think - I can't help you - the truth is that the Matrix pulling the strings of the people around you - 

friends and family tend to morph into Agent Smith to discourage you from taking risk, investing, or starting a business

This is because society needs slaves to function - and it also keeps potentially dangerous people from doing crime by giving them a noble goal

to pursuit - to be a good law abiding member of society - Just as animals hunt for their meal everyday - humans must work to put food on the table -

someone still needs to hunt and create stuff for us to trade - Otherwise society we wouldn't have a society - How would we feed people without farmers?  

Who would build the roads and buildings without workers? We work to create value and that forms a society for people to trade goods and services

Contrary to what indoctrination camps, schools or jails conditioned you to believe - its ok to make mistakes 

they're the fuel for growth - The successful among us sacrifice and bargain with the future - A winner is just an experienced loser.

You don't need to be a walking encyclopedia to be smart - you just need a powerful mindset that will get you through anything - its not about how much you know, 

but how you think that matters - The Law of Attraction states that "What you think starts a vibration that influences how you feel, impacts what you attract and 

creates your reality - so choose your thoughts wisely!" Why would you have negative thoughts and program your own brain to be against you?  As Elon Musk says,

"I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right" - Having a pessimistic mindset because "you're just being realistic" doesn't make you  

smarter than everyone else, it just makes people dislike you - no one likes pessimistic people - According to the buddha - All that we are is the result of what we 

thought - the mind is everything - what we think we become.  So if you correct your mind the rest will fall into place.  Watch your thoughts - they become words

Watch your words - they become actions - watch your actions - they become habits - Watch your habits - they become your character 

Watch your Character - it becomes your destiny - Not-knowing is true knowledge.  Presuming to know is a disease.  First realize that you are sick,

then you can move towards health - Everybody is a genius.  But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing

that it is stupid. 

Anyways have you ever asked yourself - what is money ?  Do you know ?  Do you really know?

Because most people don't - and spend their entire lifes pursuing these magical pieces of papers without ever knowing what they even are!

Its proposterous! Its like, everyone knows how to drive a car but only a few know how it works under the hood - and the same can be said

for money - everyone knows how to spend money but no body understands what it is - If you were a NASCAR racer - wouldn't you want to know how

the car works under the hood so you can best modify your vehicle for the ultimate performance? - So for everyone chasing money - wouldn't it be wise for you 

to understand how money works to maximise your cash flow ? - I've ran some experiments of my own asking people 

"What is money?" and the answers I get range from "oh its a piece of paper" to "its the source of all evil" - however no one seems to get it right

The responses I get are describing functions of money - but don't answer the fundamental question - what is money? - in case you didn't know, 

all money is - is a database - a tool humans created for the purpose of enabling trade amongst each other - Money is actually older than civilization itself - 

Money can be described as something valuable we use to trade value - For example 

Primates, like the bonobos, are known to use sex as a form of currency.  Female bonobos trade sex for food and obtain a males favors.

Back when we were still hunters and gatherers - living in tribes and villages - debts and credits were kept in the head as a mental ledger -

If you don't know, a ledger is a complete record of a company's transactions over a period of time, documenting changes to assets, liabilities, equity, 

expenses and revenue.  Back then, barter was cash - for instance - someone would give you their daughter in exchange for some cows - or some pigs for some chickens - 

food for raw materials - when trading outside tribal villages people needed something scalable that everyone agreed had value - 

So barter evolved into commodity money and gave birth to market economies - For a commodity or currency to be recognized as money, 

it must be fungible, stable, recognizeable, portable, durable, divisible, uniform, with a limited supply, and acceptable.

Fungibility means the comoddity is replaceable or interchangable with another identical item; with no noticeable difference in quality, not impacting value 

and utility.  Money must obviously be portable, otherwise how are you supposed to transact?  You need to get payed some how right? - 

It also needs to be divisible to allow people to transact value proportionate to how valuable people think something is 

Money needs to be durable to stand the test of time and allow for the store of wealth. It must be uniform, something everyone can recognize and accept.

And most importantly Money should have a fixed supply - because it turns money into database of wealth.  I mean look at it this way - imagine all the money in the 

world is represented by this pie - what you have in your bank or pockets represents a slice of the pie - a portion of the money and wealth that exists in the world

Want to know what inflation is?  Well if money is a database - and all the money in the world can be represented by this pie - look closely 

at what happens when government prints more money - ... *music playing* ... Woah! Spooky right? Woah! Thats how inflation works - 

So now you know printing money is literally taking a slice of your pie and redistributing it. 

If the pie example didn't make sense thats ok - lets look at it another way - you understand fractions right?  Well lets pretend theres a fixed number to 

the amount of money there is in the world - lets say theres only 10 dollars in the world and you own 1 of them - one day the government decided to print

90 dollars more and now instead of owning 1/10th of all the money in the world - you now own 1/100th - and the printing never stops - and since

everyone is fighting for a larger share of the pie - thats why the price of everything rises - your dollars are loosing value - 

Currency is an instrument that functions like a common language between people that allows us transact value - In Ancient Rhome it was salt - 

For the Aztecs it was cacao beans - It was Whale Teeth in Fiji - Yak Dung in Tibet - Shells in Africa and China - 

grains, metals, ivory, rare stones, leather, fish, if it had the 5 characteristics of comoddity money someone probably used it as currency
