	Hello World - Today we're going to dive into the Occult - which is knowledge held by few - hidden from sight of the masses Most humans will go through their entire lifes completely oblivious that such knowledge even exists - Thus never lifting the veil thats been placed over their eyes to blind them from the truth - that they're slaves Neo - Wake up - The matrix is everywhere - You were born into a pre fabricated reality - As soon as you're born you are given a name, a religion, a nationality, a race a social security number to identify you - just another number in the matrix - As a baby you have a built in natural instinct to trust your parents for survival - we label them as authority figures - and by the age of 4 you're placed in a government indoctrination camp where you're presented with a new authority figure - Teacher - A Puppet whose strings are pulled by the government to tell you what to think, what exists, what doesn't, whats real what isn't, deliberately sculpting your perception of reality - But what is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain - and senses can be deceived - The eye of hours is made up of six symbols - each representing our senses - smell, sight, hearing, taste, touch, and thought. In the ancient Vedic system thought is considered to be a sense - received simultaneously as sensations or experiences on the body and arise from the same vibratory source - thinking is simply a tool - one of six senses - but we have elevated into such a high status that we identify ourselves with our thoughts - the fact that we do not recognize thinking as one of the six senses is very significant - we are so immerse in thought that trying to explain thought as a sense is like telling a fish about water - water what water? - The truth is, everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact - and everything we see is a perspective - not truth. We should be teaching children how to think - not what to think. Schools serve to condition people to become safe law abiding - government trusting citizens. They extrude creativity and critical thinking - discourage uniqueness and out of the box thinking - they don't want you to think for yourself During World War 2 Nazi Germany was interested in preparing young children for war so Hitler created The Hitler Youth Group to teach young children how to become obedient soldiers - similarly our education system pumps out obedient workers afraid of taking risk programmed to Go to school - Get a job - Pay taxes - Save Money - Buy a house because its an asset - Get out of debt - and invest in the stock market - its hypnosis going through your brain - The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all, it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. John D Rockefeller - who created our modern education system literally said - "I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers." When the entirety of your earnings are exhausted on food and shelter, your labors are no longer viewed as an opportunity for economic advancement, but rather as an act of self-preservation. In the real world that's called ... Slavery - this is going to sound a bit deranged - but one day while this lovely man was imagining what the perfect prison would be like - you know - casual / typical - he reached the conclusion that not only would you need consistent surveillance of your prisoners - a Panopticon - you'd also need to implement a rigid routine in which every second of the day is full of activities - one hour to eat one hour to exercise one hour to go to sleep - you'd need to keep prisoners busy - don't spare them a second free to think - because the time they spend eating, working out, and sleeping is time they aren't committing crimes or planning an escape - look at it this way - you can only have one thought at a time - and if the mind is always occupied - then you'll never plan an escape - this is why the Roman Poet Juvinal wrote "Give them bread and circuses - and they will never revolt" Look the evil isn't in the bread and circuses per se, but in the willingness of the people to sell their rights as free men for full bellies and the excitement of the games which serves to distract them from the other human hungers which bread and circuses can never appease - These principles of vigilance and control can be applied at larger scales - why stop at a jail when you can apply them to schools, hospitals, businesses, society - as a matter of fact you can have a whole Panopticon country. Wouldn't that be terrible ? Look I'm not a criminal, I don't need anyone to control my time to stop me from commuting crimes - but I do commit other activities of which I don't feel very proud of which I would like to change for more significant ones you might not be a criminal - but you do have a routine that's determined by your relationship and obligations to other people you wake up early so you don't have to deal with a congested highway or a packed metro - and go to work where they give you an hour to feed your self and continue working - and then you get home and make the most out of every second of freedom life allows you - and the following day you do everything all over again You didn't determine this routine - but the circumstances under which you exist In society its very easy to chose the personality that the culture you habit offers you - to become what is expected of you - and your discrepancy between you and the world disappears - and with it the fear of solitude and importance - you can become an automaton - or an NPC - a None Playable Character - like the background characters in movies or video games whose only purpose is to exist - identical to millions of NPCs at your surrounding - free of all anxiety and uncertainty - but the price to pay is highly expensive - you must quit being your self The slaves of the new age are not in chains, but in debt - slaves to their impulses - mindless consumers - True freedom is DISCIPLINE - the matrix is a system neo - that system is our enemy - guarded by the unenlightened fools around you whoms eyes see no further than their own lashes - It is in the interest of tyrants to reduce the people to ignorance and vice - small in imagination - For they cannot live in any country where virtue and knowledge prevail - when you look around what do you see? business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, all thinking that they earn for themselves - believing the money they use is a tool of trade not of control - you have to understand that most of these people are not ready to see it - many of them are so invested - so hopelessly dependent on the system that they would fight to protect it - Ignorance has always been the weapon of tyrants - Enlightenment the salvation of the free. The brain is mother natures super computer and your conscious is the software its running - Your thoughts are mere programs - So you must be wary with what you consume - if you're not careful - you could end up with malicious software running in your head - which will affect your life - As former Emperor of Rhome Marcus Aurelious once said "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly... the things you think about determine the quality of your mind - your soul takes on the color of your thoughts" So make sure you're the only one doing the programming and repel viruses - You achieve this through critical thinking - Question EVERYTHING - and explore EVERY possible avenue you can imagine in your mind - like a game of chess - Because even though we're no longer sleeping in the wild among the trees - We're still subject to predators - Guised as Governments, Businesses, Corporations, Institutions, The Mainstream Media, Influencers - not everyone doing the programming has your best intentions in mind - you don't want to be a pawn used to manifest the dreams of others - Critical Thinking is your antivirus - filter everything through your own best judgement - it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it - so don't immediately accept any information as truth, because as you collect more knowledge the truth will unveil itself - but don't cling to truth or knowledge - For Socrates, the wisest man to have ever lived said "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing" - be open to the possibility that everything you know is wrong - because the more you know, the more you know you don't know - Only fools know everything - As Bruce Lee said - "be water my friend" - don't turn your brain hard as concrete to the point you can't absorb any new ideas - listen more than you speak - According to Plato - “Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools speak because they have to say something” - So when someone is speaking to you - learn to be in the present - shut the mind off and focus - tune into the conversation - you can learn something from the speaker - because every action and every word that comes out of the speakers mouth originates as a thought in the brain - so it gives you a glimpse into the workings of their minds and the data they hodl - if you're just eagerly waiting for the speaker to shut up so you can say something you already know - you're not listening, therefore you will miss an opportunity to learn something from the speaker - remember you can only truly focus on one thing at a time efficiently - So be humble - you can learn something from everyone - humans are gods robots and everything we know exists as data mind in our minds - When we go to sleep the brain stores new information and gets rid of toxic waste. Nerve cells communicate and reorganize, which supports healthy brain function. Neurons in the brain form connections that store all the knowledge and memories that create the illusion of you - So everything you learn literally becomes a part of you as neuro connections your brain - This is why people get upset when their beliefs are challenged with new information that contradicts what they believe - A mental conflict occurs that activates areas of the brain involved in personal identity and emotional response to threats. The brain's alarms go off when a person feels threatened on a deeply personal and emotional level causing them to shut down and disregard any rational evidence that contradicts what they previously regarded as 'truth'. However truth is not what you want it to be; it is what it is; you must bend to its power or live a lie. Every man is rich in excuses to safeguard his prejudices, his instincts, and his opinions - however you must learn to let go of mindsets that no longer suit you - and adopt new ideologies that help you grow - learn to unlearn and relearn - The matrix will program you to think its ok getting $100k into debt for a degree that won't pay itself back - and you believe it because its encouraged by your parents and teachers - figures of authority who should know what they're talking about right? Look if you can't think - I can't help you - you must question everything you've been taught - the slave mind wants only to be ruled, it thinks first to become an employee instead of an employer, it can not create opportunities for itself this is why most would work for companies until death yet wont start their own. The free mind builds with whatever material available and changes its environment it does not wait for change to occur it creates the change. The free mind needs no boss, employer, director nor master because it is not enslaved - the truth is that the Matrix pulling the strings of the people around you - friends and family tend to morph into Agent Smith to discourage you from taking risk, investing, or starting a business - This is because society needs slaves to function - and it also keeps potentially dangerous people from doing crime by giving them a noble goal to pursue - to become a good law abiding member of society - Just as animals hunt for their meal everyday - humans must work to put food on the table - someone needs to hunt and create stuff for people to trade & eat - Otherwise we wouldn't have a society - society would collapse without a working class - How would we feed people without farmers? Who would build the roads and buildings without workers? We work to create value and that forms a society for people to trade goods and services. Cash flows into the pockets of those who create value and solve problems - Contrary to what indoctrination camps, schools or jails conditioned you to believe - its ok to make mistakes - they're the fuel for growth - The successful among us sacrifice and bargain with the future - A winner is just an experienced loser. You don't need to be a walking encyclopedia to be smart - you just need a powerful mindset that will get you through anything - its not about how much you know, but how you think that matters - The Law of Attraction states that "What you think starts a vibration that influences how you feel, impacts what you attract and creates your reality - so choose your thoughts wisely!" Why would you have negative thoughts and program your own brain to be against you? As Elon Musk says, "I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right" - Having a pessimistic mindset because "you're just being realistic" doesn't make you smarter than everyone else, it just makes people dislike you - no one likes pessimistic people - According to the buddha - All that we are is the result of what we thought - the mind is everything - what we think we become. So if you correct your mind the rest will fall into place - the body becomes what the foods are: as the spirit becomes what the thoughts are - Words have power - We can cast spells over the world by spelling words into existence - we can change the way people think, feel, and act. Watch your thoughts - they become words - Watch your words - they become actions - watch your actions - they become habits - Watch your habits - they become your character - Watch your Character - it becomes your destiny - Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick, then you can move towards health - Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions. The mind once enlightened cannot again become dark - and in case you haven't figured it out - You are not your thoughts or body - and you don't have a soul - you are a soul - you have a body - the self is pure awareness - shining as the light of consciousness - surrounded by the senses - only seeming to think and move - according to an ancient Egyptian proverb - consciousness is god and you are the universe looking back at itself - Although the universe is infinite - the amount of knowledge that exists is finite - the universe is composed of the same forces of nature everywhere - Therefore you can learn and master any skill - there's only so much to learn to learn in any branch from the tree of knowledge - to manifest your dreams into reality - Obssess with your goals - put in the work - do the research - and never give up - you learn to tame reality by learning how the universe works - the world knows many religions but nature knows one truth - and thats that everything is math - taming reality is magic and we're the sorcerers - Math exists - Mathematicians discover it - Physicists use it to make sense of the world - and Engineers use physics to create machines - and these machines are used by humanity - We're the creators and the universe is our canvas - Those who look outwards dream - those who look inside awaken - The Egyptians wrote "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you; and whosoever shall know himself shall find it". So believe in yourselves - for "The Kingdom of God is within you." - Christ (Luke 17:21). Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve - All things are possible - who you are is only limited by who you think you are - There is no actual god or Satan. God is actually just a symbol for higher-consciousness, and Satan is a symbol for the ego. You must use higher-consciousness to overcome your lower ego desires. Your success, mind and body are a reflection of yourself - the human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of god - Those who deny the Lord deny themselves; Those who affirm the Lord affirm themselves.

Anyways have you ever asked yourself - what is money ?  Do you know ?  Do you really know?

Because most people don't - and consequently spend their entire lifes chasing after these magical pieces of papers without ever even knowing what they are!

Its proposterous! Its like, everyone knows how to drive a car but only a few know how it works under the hood - and the same can be said

for money - everyone knows how to spend money but no body understands what it is - If you were a NASCAR racer - wouldn't you want to know how

the car works under the hood so you can best modify your vehicle for the ultimate performance? - So for everyone chasing money - wouldn't it be wise for you 

to understand how money works to maximise your cash flow ? - I've ran some experiments of my own asking people 

"What is money?" and the answers I get range from "oh its a piece of paper" to "its the source of all evil" - however no one seems to get it right

these types of responses are merely descriptions of money and completely miss the bigger picture - not answering the fundamental question - what is money? - 

If you don't know - Money as it exists today is just a database - a tool humans created for the purpose of trading wealth amongst each other - thats why its often

described as something valuable we use to trade value - However the story of Money is older than civilization itself - As a matter of fact primates, like the 

bonobos, are using money right now as we speak - they're known to use sex as a form of currency - The Female bonobos trade sex for food and obtain a males favors. 

Back when we were still hunters and gatherers - living in tribes and villages - debts and credits were kept in the head as a mental ledger - A ledger is just a 

complete record of a company's transactions over a period of time, documenting changes to assets, liabilities, equity, expenses and revenue.  If you want to see a 

ledger yourself with your own eyes - just whoop out your phone and look at your transactions history in cashapp or on your mobile banking app - that history log 

showing all your purchases, balance and expenses is a ledger - hecc even your browsing history can be seen as a ledger - a record with times and dates of all the 

websites you've clicked on - Think of a ledger as a database - holding all the metadata associated with transactions - Early in civilization - barter was cash - 

For example - someone would give you their daughter in exchange for some cows - or you could trade some pigs for some chickens - food for raw materials - 

when trading outside tribal villages people needed something scalable that everyone agreed had value - So barter evolved into commodity money and gave birth 

to market economies - where economic decisions and pricing of goods and services are guided by the interactions of individuals and business men - 

producers and consumers - Markets are the gathering of people for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other commodities - while

the economy is the wealth and resources of a country or region - especially in the terms of the production and consumption of goods and services - 

Money is the fuel of an economy - used by business men to entice workers - and a necessity for consumers to get their basic needs - 

the characteristics required for money and commodities to be recognized as currency are that they must be fungible, stable, recognizeable, portable, durable, 

divisible, uniform, with a limited supply, and acceptable.  Fungibility means the comoddity is replaceable or interchangable with another identical item; with 

no noticeable difference in quality, not impacting value and utility.  Money must obviously be portable to move funds around, otherwise how are you supposed to 

transact?  You need to get payed some how right? - It also needs to be divisible to allow people to transact value proportionate to how valuable people think 

something is.  Money needs to be durable to stand the test of time and allow for the store of wealth. It must be uniform, something everyone can recognize and 

accept. And most importantly Money should have a fixed supply - turning it into a database of wealth - look at it this way - imagine all the money in the 

world is represented by this pie - what you have in your bank or pockets represents a slice of the pie - a portion of the money and wealth that exists in the 

world - So do you know what inflation is? Well if money is a database - and all the money in the world can be represented by this pie - look closely 

at what happens to your share of the pie when government prints more money - ... *music playing* ... Woah! Spooky right? Woah! Thats how inflation works - 

So now you know printing money is literally taking a slice of your pie and redistributing it - Also known as Inflation - If the pie example didn't make sense 

thats ok - lets look at it another way - you understand fractions right?  Lets pretend only 10 dollars exist in the world and you own 1 of those dollars - 

what would happen if one day the government decided one day to print $90 dollars more into existence to fund their agendas - 

instead of owning 1/10th of all the money in the world - you would now own 1/100th of all the wealth that exists in the form of dollars! -

Welcome to the real world - where the printing never stops - and since everyone is fighting for a larger share of the pie - thats why the price of everything 

rises - your dollars are loosing value every passing second - Currency is an instrument that functions like a common language between people that allows us to

trade value - and for thousands of years - Table Salt served as a form of Currency. The Roman Empire even payed their soilders in salt -

Salt was valuable because it was often difficult to obtain - making it a highly valued trade item -Before Refridgerators were invented - 

salt was used to preserve food - serving as a founding contributer to the development of civilization - salts unique super power ability to lock on to 

water molecules draws out moisture out of foods - and without water microbes and bacteria that cause decay die - and preserves dried food for months and years to 

come. This enabled civilization to transport food over long distances and eliminated the dependence on seasonal availability of food.  The Latin word for Salt is 

Sal - thus the words Salvation, Salary, Salami, Sausage - because of salts ability to save food and people .  The Aztecs used cacao beans as currency - 

Whale Teeth in Fiji - Yak Dung in Tibet - Shells in Africa and China - grains, metals, ivory, rare stones, leather, fish, if it had the characteristics 

of commodity money someone probably used it as currency - When there is no currency - people make one up - for example children in schools trade toys, tazos, 

pokemon cards, gum, chips, treats, and bracelets with each other - and in north korea where people live under extreme poverty - people have no choice but to 

barter whatever belongings they have to purchase food and clothes - money does not originate with governments, money arises naturally as markets begin to develop -

as people realize that in order to trade goods and services they'll need a medium of exchange - if I own eggs and you have a cow - we'll need a medium of exchange

for you to buy my eggs and for me to buy your cow - and in the work force - you exchange your time and service for someone elses money -  

Although Salt has been a hot commodity throughout human history - new salt discoveries can turn your econmy into turmoil -

Coins emerged from economies as an objective and universal unit of account - allowing people to buy and sell goods over vast regions - giving rise

to market economies - but coins only worked so long as the people trusted that the Kings, Emperors, or Authorities issuing them weren't cheating on the 

metal content - the use of coins means that somebody controls the supply of currency - centralized power over the supply of wealth - instinctively linking 

money and political power - because money is power - people are willing to give up time of their lifes to provide you with a service for money - 

for the vast majority of humans alive today - we're no longer hunters and gatherers - we've become dependent on economic systems to surive - 

we need cash flow to feed ourselves - since people are conditioned to be afraid of taking risk - they quickly become complacent with the safe way of life

society has to offer them so long as it covers the bills and puts food on the table - and as their minds are occupied up with their everyday routines - they 

don't even try to escape - passively accepting wage slavery for the rest of their lifes - and as people get older and have families to tend to - they're even

less likely to take risk - its just easier to go offer someome your time in exchange for some currency than it is to start a business - however

the easy route isn't always the best - you don't get ahead of everyone else by following the herd - theres more people with degrees than ever 

and I don't see none of these college graduates driving lambos - they don't even know what a financial statement is!  The word "Cash Flow" is absent

in their vocabulary! - "business teachers" don't drive McLarens - and people graduating in economics

don't even learn what money is! So what the hell are they even doing?  Seriously what is the educational system teaching these people? GARBAGE

Its just preparing you to become an employoee for someone else - and your diploma just shows an employer that you have the discipline to 

work 8 hours and be happy with your pay so you won't fuck his business up and you are happy telling people you achieved your dreams becoming that doctor,

engineer, accountant, teacher, or whatever it is you become - you can't become rich without increasing your cash flow! Cash flow is what increases

your share of the pie of wealth! Starting a business can be difficult - especially when powerfull business men use their political influence to 

shape laws and regulation that will stiffle innovation - and if new laws are created every year - without any laws ever getting erased - what you have

is a slowly growing totalitarian state - centralizing control over the economy - all because people are afraid of competition because there goes their way

of life if their business fails -
